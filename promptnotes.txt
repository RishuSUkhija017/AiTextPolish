I want to create a chrome extension, just like Grammarly, that will call Google Gemini's API.

Upon highlighting a text and then right clicking, it should show an option to correct grammar or spelling mistakes.
The highlighted text will be passed to the API and it will be replaced by the text which will be returned by the API.



Modify the code to generate three options, on right-click (for the highlighted text).
First option - to correct grammar and spelling
second option - change the tone of the text to formal
third option - to rephrase it

There should be an option for the user, if he wants to use the suggestions by the API.

Upon clicking any of the above options, show user 3 suggestions from the API.


I just want suggestions and not the text around it. 
Description is also being shown in one of the suggested texts.
Fix it.
